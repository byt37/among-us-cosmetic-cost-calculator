## How It Works
This project includes metadata and image assets for most cosmetics available in **Among Us**.  
The calculator adds up their in-game cost across different currencies — Beans, Stars, and Pods (grouped by Cosmicube type).

Each cosmetic’s cost, availability, and unlock requirements are based on data from **Innersloth’s game content** and publicly available information on the [Among Us Wiki](https://among-us.fandom.com/wiki/Among_Us_Wiki).
